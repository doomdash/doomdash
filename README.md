**DoomDash** is a wad/source port launcher for quick start. Its design goal is to 
be simple for use by gamers, who are new to wad landscape.

It is heavily inspired and probably will be built upon 
[SSGL](https://github.com/FreaKzero/ssgl-doom-launcher) 
and [GZDeck](https://github.com/flegald/GZDeck) launchers.


## Project status
The project is on the very early stage. I'm trying to test my idea and find the buddies who will join this project. Read about my idea in the detail in this gist: https://gist.github.com/skorphil/51e6eaaa1401eec81937aa7ff74c8c92

My plan so far is to built simple prototype which can demonstrate the vibe and purpose of a new launcher.

The ideas and feedback are highly appreciated.
